# Java component, package and artifact detailed design

Status: working draft / focused detailed design

Software item: **SI-01 — Timing Point Application**

## Purpose

This SDD describes the **Java implementation** of the SI-01 design: Maven
modules, packages, classes/interfaces, composition, queues/threads and provider
loading.

## Terms and abbreviations

- **SDD** — Software Design Description
- **SSD** — Software Specification Document
- **SI** — Software Item
- **JAR** — Java archive
- **Maven** — Java build and dependency tool


## Relationship to other documents

This SDD refines the SI-01 SSD and SDD-01 into concrete Java structure. Applicable
ISDs/IDDs remain the external contract; this document selects Java mechanisms that
realise those decisions. The Java implementation and component tests are downstream.

The SSD says what the architecture must do. SDD-01 describes the LogBook/data
flow. IDDs such as IF-05 define external/file contracts. This document picks the
Java mechanisms that implement those decisions.

## Why this SDD exists

This detail is separate because module/package choices directly affect the Java
repository, dependencies and what can be reused by other applications.

The central rule is:

> **An architecture layer or Java package is not automatically a Maven artifact.**

Keep these concepts distinct:

1. **Architecture responsibility** — semantic ownership and dependency direction, defined by the SSD architecture.
2. **Java package** — cohesive source organisation and enforceable dependency discipline.
3. **Maven artifact** — reusable library or deployable application with a concrete consumer/lifecycle reason to exist.
4. **Application composition** — assembly of application-core code and selected implementations into an executable.
5. **Contract/port** — semantic boundary placed with the responsibility that owns its meaning.

A separate artifact is justified only by a real consumer, reuse, dependency, lifecycle, deployment, ownership, public/private, release or versioning boundary.

## Initial Maven reactor

The current reactor has two reusable artifacts plus one executable application.
The shared TimingData library artifact is justified by the independent SI-01 and
Engineering Client consumers. It intentionally remains one artifact containing the
semantic contracts, default/reference profile, codec and factory/provider; these
responsibilities are not split into separate API/default JARs:

```text
reactor/
├── pom.xml                    timing-point-parent
├── shared/
│   └── timing-data/
│       └── pom.xml            event-timing-data.jar
├── core/
│   └── pom.xml                timing-point-core.jar
└── app/
    └── pom.xml                timing-point-app.jar
```

Working coordinates:

```text
groupId: io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming

parent:          timing-point-parent
TimingData:      event-timing-data
core:            timing-point-core
executable:      timing-point-app
```

The root POM only groups/configures the build; it is not a runtime component.

The `core/` Maven module is the reusable **application core of SI-01**. It contains
the main application, domain, presentation, I/O, infrastructure, runtime and
Platform implementation that is shared by executable compositions. The name
`core` is an artifact/source boundary only: it does **not** reintroduce a
separate Core architecture layer in Figure SI01-01. The executable `app/`
module stays deliberately thin and adds the launcher, concrete runtime-provider
selection and packaging needed to run that core.

The Maven `groupId` remains the **event-timing software-system/product-family** coordinate. SI-01 Java code is more specific: the reusable application core and default executable live under `io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint`. `TimingPoint` names the local software/deployment role; it does **not** replace the internal `TimingNode` domain aggregate. One Timing Point Application process may host 1..N TimingSystems and therefore multiple TimingNodes.

## Package direction

The current Java structure should grow from real code, not from the architecture
diagram.

Likely top-level packages are:

```text
io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming/timingpoint/
  application/
  domain/
  platform/
    execution/
    events/
    environment/
  presentation/
    interfaces/
      api/
      console/
      shell/
      web/
    common/
      terminal/
  io/
    devices/
      antenna/
      display/
      keypad/
      beeper/
    devicenetworks/
      can/
      network/
    messaging/
    storage/
  infra/
    config/
    logging/
    loggingserver/
  runtime/
    config/
```

Presentation subpackages are organised by **functional interface first**. Console, Remote Shell, Web and API are separate presentation interfaces. The intended Web topology is one configured Web endpoint/binding per TimingNode (1..N), each with its own presentation port and a `TimingNodeId` reference. HTTP/WebSocket are implementation transports inside a functional interface, not global presentation categories. The primary API classes stay directly at `presentation.interfaces.api` while that component is small; a one-class `http`, `websocket` or `messages` package would hide the component overview without adding a useful boundary. `presentation.common.terminal` contains only terminal handling genuinely shared by Console and Remote Shell; `presentation.common` is not a generic dumping ground.

These are source-organisation boundaries, not automatically Maven modules.

Use these rules:

- create a class only when current behaviour needs it;
- keep small enums with the object that owns them until reuse justifies a
  separate type;
- do not create marker classes to represent layers;
- place a type by what it means, not by which layer happens to call it;
- keep primary component/capability classes visible at that component package
  root so opening the package gives a useful architecture overview;
- do not introduce a subpackage merely to classify one class by transport,
  message shape or implementation role;
- use a deeper subpackage for a cohesive supporting family when it materially
  improves navigation, or when multiple real sub-capabilities need their own
  namespace;
- preserve Java encapsulation when choosing package boundaries: subpackages do
  not share package-private access, so do not split implementation helpers only
  to make a tree look tidy if that would force a wider API;
- use capability-oriented subpackages when a domain concept has a main object plus
  closely related value/supporting types; keep that small group together rather
  than introducing generic `helper`, `model` or single-type `identity`
  subpackages;
- reserve `platform` for small JDK-only reusable primitives and execution-environment abstractions, including bounded/serial execution and typed local events;
- reserve `infra` for concrete cross-cutting technical support such as `BuildIdentity`, logging, diagnostics and configuration/extension adapters;
- reserve `runtime` for concrete application composition, the running application container and lifecycle;
- use `io` for external hardware, messaging and storage adapters.

The shared TimingData artifact has its own package root:

```text
shared/timing-data/
  io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingdata/
    TimingData.java
      AutomaticRegistration
      ManualRegistration
      ManualTimeSource
      RecordKey
    LocationId.java
    RegistrationId.java
    TimingTimestamp.java
    TimingDataFactory.java
      Context
    TimingDataCodec.java
      CodecException
    TimingDataProvider.java
    defaultprofile/
      DefaultTimingDataFactory.java
      DefaultTimingDataCodec.java
      private automatic/manual default value implementations
```

`TimingDataFactory.Context` is the one immutable value-only construction context for
fields shared by every TimingData variant. Do not mirror the semantic type tree
with `AutomaticRegistrationContext`, `ManualRegistrationContext` or nested
per-variant context types.

For example, the first TimingNode implementation is grouped as:

```

The names above record ownership/direction, not a requirement to create empty
types early. Lower layers expose generic contracts that do not import higher
layers. TimingData-specific persistence semantics stay in Domain and use the
generic `io.storage.AppendOnlyRecordStore`; the file implementation remains
completely unaware of TimingData, TimingNode and Domain types.
`SerialWorker` is a small reusable execution primitive under `platform.execution`,
composed into TimingNode rather than used as a Domain superclass. It has no
TimingNode or persistence semantics of its own.

`TimingNode` remains the visible Domain component boundary used by higher layers. It owns serialized access through `SerialWorker`, operation admission/timeout mapping and post-commit event publication. Package-private `TimingNodeLogic` contains the mutable node state and domain decisions: lifecycle, current `LocationId`, LogBook interaction and TimingData commit behaviour. `TimingNodeLogic` is an implementation detail of the TimingNode component, not a second architecture component.

A production `TimingNode` is always constructed as a complete capability. `TimingDataPersistence`, `TimingDataFactory` and `TimeSource` are required constructor dependencies; there is no lifecycle-only or partially configured production node. The only non-public construction seam exists for deterministic TimingNode execution-boundary tests and is documented as test-only in code.

`TimingNodeTypes` is only a Java source-code grouping for the public TimingNode status/result/exception value types. It has no runtime state, lifecycle or architectural responsibility and therefore does not appear as another component in Figure SI01-01.

The application `PresentationGateway` is always composed with a complete
`TimingNode`; there is no status-only or partially configured production
gateway. Presentation tests use complete test fixtures rather than adding a
second production construction mode.

`PresentationGateway` is an Application-layer component named for the adjacent
Presentation side whose traffic it mediates. Gateway names describe the side of
the architectural boundary, not the owning package/layer. `UpstreamGateway`
follows the same naming principle on the I/O/upstream boundary, but owns external
transport/integration rather than presentation-facing application operations.

Node-scoped presentation access is exposed through `TimingNodeProxy`.
`PresentationGateway` owns application-wide presentation information such as
build identity and capabilities; the proxy gives an adapter explicit TimingNode
context for node status, commands, queries and events. The proxy is an
Application-layer boundary object, not a second owner of TimingNode state.

Status-change detection remains owned by the TimingNode serial boundary. A
state-changing command compares authoritative status before and after the domain
operation on that TimingNode lane. A real difference emits the TimingNode status
event before the result leaves ordered command execution. `TimingNodeProxy` maps
that fact to `ApplicationStatus`; it does not perform a second before/after query
outside the ordered boundary.

The visible Domain component boundary uses typed commands and queries rather than
mirroring every `TimingNodeLogic` method:

```java
TimingNodeTypes.OpenResult opened =
        node.invoke(TimingNodeCommands.open(locationId));

TimingNodeTypes.CommandAdmission admitted =
        node.submit(
                TimingNodeCommands.addAutomaticRegistration(
                        registrationId,
                        time));

TimingNodeTypes.Status status =
        node.query(TimingNodeQueries.status());
```

Presentation adapters use the node-scoped Application boundary:

```java
TimingNodeProxy node = presentationGateway.timingNode();

node.open(locationId);
node.applyAutomaticRegistration(
        AutomaticRegistrationAction.ADD,
        registrationId,
        time);
node.statusChangedEvent().subscribe(statusListener);
node.timingDataCommittedEvent().subscribe(timingDataListener);
```

`invoke(command)` is the result-bearing path: presentation/application callers may
wait for the processed domain result. `submit(command)` is the producer path: it
returns only immediate bounded-queue admission and deliberately does not wait for
the later domain result. RFID/TagProcessor-style ingress uses this form so a device
callback cannot be held up by persistence, LogBook work or another queued TimingNode
operation.

`query(query)` is the consistency-sensitive read path. Short reads run in the same
ordering as commands. The ordering boundary is the required property; a copied
LogBook snapshot is not. Query implementations should avoid routine list copies
when direct bounded traversal on the node lane is cheaper, and may introduce
compact derived/indexed state only when measurement justifies it. Typed
command/query objects are local operation descriptions, not another component,
central dispatcher or generic message bus.

The presentation-facing automatic-registration boundary is
`applyAutomaticRegistration(action, registrationId, time)`. The action is explicit
because an automatic-registration record can later express more than one semantic
action; the current implemented action set contains only `ADD` until REV semantics
are defined. The Domain command for that implemented action is
`addAutomaticRegistration(...)`. The short IF-03 engineering resource name
`auto-reg` remains a transport concern.

`ApplicationId`, internal `TimingSystemId` and functional
`TimingNodeId` are separate Java identities. `TimingSystemId` distinguishes
multiple hosted/simulated systems locally; it is not automatically serialized
into TimingData or exposed as an upstream address.

Each `TimingSystem` owns one Domain `TimeSource`. The production implementation
may delegate to a Platform wall-clock abstraction; tests/simulations may provide
a controllable implementation with a per-system offset or stepped time. The
Domain contract returns project-owned absolute `TimingTimestamp` values rather
than exposing a platform clock API directly. Monotonic duration/time-out sources
remain separate Platform/runtime concerns.

The I/O package structure is logical; executable composition is per
`TimingSystem`. Hosting 1..N TimingSystems therefore normally constructs 1..N
corresponding I/O compositions, each with its own configured Storage, Devices,
Messaging and DeviceNetworks objects. Explicit lower-level multiplexing may share
a physical resource, but the owning TimingSystem contexts stay separate.

`CanNetworkController` owns CAN-network lifecycle/discovery and CAN-device
communication. `NetworkDeviceService` owns the general bidirectional
network-device boundary. It may expose application data outward and accept
device-originated messages/events inward.

The high-level architecture deliberately stops there. Service discovery,
connection/listener/session handling and protocol framing are lower-level design
concerns below `NetworkDeviceService`. Likewise, a smart-display/domain handler
should not acquire socket, mDNS or transport knowledge merely because it is
reached through this service. The smart display remains an external client and
therefore does not require a `Rev2WifiDisplay` class inside SI-01 merely to
mirror the hardware name.

`TimingNode` contains its passive `LogBook` as part of the TimingNode
aggregate. LogBook keeps 0..N committed `TimingData` values. The current
design deliberately avoids a second logbook-specific record type because there
is no different domain shape that needs one.

`TimingData` remains the Domain capability/contract name and becomes the small
shared Java interface implemented by concrete profile values. The default profile
and validation/codec services realise the system-owned IF-05 contract. Concrete
storage, Web and messaging adapters may carry that record or its encoded form
without redefining field semantics.

`UpstreamProtocol` is a Domain capability owned by one `TimingSystem` and built partly on `TimingData`. It adds synchronization/reconciliation and protocol-level messages such as ping/pong so individual TimingNodes do not need to implement those concerns. `UpstreamGateway` owns the external transport boundary and uses 1..N concrete connectors. A connector such as `RabbitMqConnector` or `DebugConnector` owns transport/session mechanics, not TimingData or UpstreamProtocol semantics. `DebugConnector` is the engineering transport intended for an independent desktop/debug tool; that tool remains an external consumer rather than part of SI-01. `UpstreamMessageRouter` resolves semantic work inside the already selected TimingSystem context: system-level work uses `TimingSystem.UpstreamMessagePort`, while node-level work is resolved by `TimingNodeId` to `TimingNode.UpstreamMessagePort`. `TimingSystemId` is not required on the wire.

If the TimingNode capability later grows into several cohesive areas, deeper
packages such as `timing/registration` or `timing/stage` may become useful.
Do not create those packages before the corresponding code exists.

The Domain-level `SystemStatus` is a dedicated component contained by one `TimingSystem`. It is a semantic aggregate, not a wrapper around
concrete adapter objects and not merely an `OK` flag. It can represent current
TimingNode state together with operational I/O state such as antenna/display
connectivity, keypad/beeper availability, device-network health, storage,
upstream connectivity and synchronisation. Concrete I/O components expose or
publish semantic status inputs; `SystemStatus` must not depend on classes such
as `Rev1CanDisplay`, socket/session implementations or vendor antenna drivers.

TimingNode status reaches this aggregate as an immutable semantic snapshot/result
created through the TimingNode ownership boundary. `SystemStatus` does not call
into `LogBook`, lifecycle fields, location fields or other mutable TimingNode
internals directly.

An external interface response shape does not require an equally shaped internal Java object.
For example, the status JSON does not by itself require classes named
`ApplicationStatusSnapshot` or `ApplicationStatusModel`.

## Contract placement

Place contracts with the responsibility that owns their meaning:

```text
presentation
  functional client interfaces / transport mapping / wire messages

application
  commands, queries and application-level ports

domain
  domain model, semantic ports, per-TimingSystem TimeSource, TimingData representation/codec and UpstreamProtocol semantics

io
  hardware, messaging and storage adapters

infra
  concrete cross-cutting technical support, including logging, diagnostics,
  configuration mapping and extension discovery

runtime
  concrete application composition, top-level running application and lifecycle

platform
  small JDK-only reusable primitives and execution-environment abstractions,
  including serial execution and local typed events
```

Do not create one generic top-level `api` package merely to collect
interfaces.

## Internal dependency direction

```text
presentation --> application
application  --> domain / I/O / platform
domain       --> I/O / platform
io           --> platform / JDK
runtime      --> application / domain / presentation / I/O / infra / platform
infra        --> owned support contracts + platform / JDK / selected support libraries
platform     --> JDK and low-level environment only
```

The normal dependency direction follows the layer order and is intentionally
easy to read from imports. A lower layer does not import a higher layer merely
to implement one of its interfaces. Domain may depend on a generic I/O contract,
but not on a concrete I/O implementation; Runtime composition selects the
concrete implementation.

For example:

```text
TimingNodeLogic
  -> TimingDataPersistence
       -> AppendOnlyRecordStore
            <- FileAppendOnlyRecordStore selected by Runtime
```

`AppendOnlyRecordStore` contains only opaque-record storage semantics.
`DefaultTimingDataPersistence` owns TimingData codec, TimingNodeId and sequence
validation. This keeps `io.storage` independent from Domain.
Executable composition may depend on the complete supported application-core surface
and selected external libraries.

## Logging dependency placement

Logging follows the same library-versus-executable composition boundary.

```text
timing-point-core.jar
  -> slf4j-api only
  -> io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.infra.logging
       +-- Logging
       +-- LoggingConfig / LoggingLevel / LoggingFileConfig
       +-- LoggingControl
       +-- ConsoleHandler
       +-- TimestampedFileLogHandler + CompactLogFormatter
  -> io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.infra.loggingserver
       +-- LoggingServer
       +-- LoggingServerConfig
       +-- LiveLogHandler
       +-- client-initiated live diagnostics + temporary level control

timing-point-app.jar
  -> selects exactly one SLF4J provider
  -> initial provider: slf4j-jdk14
  -> delegates SLF4J records to java.util.logging
  -> starts/stops core-provided Logging
  -> independently starts/stops optional LoggingServer
```

Working rules:

- application-core code may compile against the SLF4J API but must not force a concrete provider/backend on consumers;
- provider-neutral deployment values stay component-owned: `LoggingConfig` contains `LoggingLevel` and `LoggingFileConfig`; optional `LoggingServerConfig` belongs to `LoggingServer`; runtime `Config` may reference both as composition data;
- the executable application chooses and configures the provider/backend before `runtime.Composition` starts normal application composition;
- the initial Java-8/Pi-Zero baseline uses `slf4j-jdk14` so the provider delegates to JDK `java.util.logging` without introducing Logback;
- concrete JUL backend/file lifecycle stays under `timingpoint.infra.logging`; the live diagnostics handler/socket lifecycle stays under `timingpoint.infra.loggingserver`; neither package defines domain/application contracts;
- `infra.logging` must not depend on `infra.loggingserver` or `runtime.config`; the thin executable starts the two infrastructure components separately before handing control to runtime composition. `infra.loggingserver` may depend on the narrow public `Logging` runtime surface for current level control and record formatting, but the logging component does not construct or own the server;
- `LoggingServerConfig` belongs to the `LoggingServer` component and carries its listener values (`bindAddress`, `port`); the default YAML loader maps the external `logging.live` syntax to that component-owned type;
- `LoggingLevel` is a logging-domain value rather than `LoggingConfig.Level`, so live level control does not depend on an umbrella configuration class;
- the core artifact owns that reusable implementation because it has no dependency on executable-specific YAML/resource loading and uses only JDK facilities plus component-owned logging configuration;
- `Logging` is the primary runtime logging infrastructure component and owns backend setup, console/file handler composition, record formatting and the current global-level control;
- `LoggingServer` is the separate externally reachable live-diagnostics component; it owns the live JUL handler plus logging-specific socket/protocol boundary, delegates temporary level changes to `Logging`, and is not a Presentation/IF-03 endpoint;
- the default retained file sink uses the local wall-clock start/rotation timestamp as a human-readable filename, normally `yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.txt`; this timestamp is not treated as a unique or monotonic session identity;
- Raspberry Pi startup must not assume that wall-clock time is already network-synchronised: the clock may repeat or move backwards across restarts, so retained log creation must use non-overwriting create semantics, add a collision suffix when necessary, and protect the active log from retention decisions regardless of timestamp ordering;
- retained text records use the compact operator-facing form `HH:mm:ss.SSS - [LEVEL] - message - [sourceClass.sourceMethod]`; exception stack traces follow the record line when present;
- `LoggingControl` owns the configured global level plus an optional temporary runtime override; applying an override changes the running logger threshold without mutating deployment configuration;
- the optional diagnostic listener is a logging-specific engineering facility. The test client initiates its TCP connection, log delivery is best effort, and network failure must not be allowed to block ordinary log publishers;
- the live diagnostics protocol is separate from the IF-03 status/event wire model;
- another executable/private consumer may select another compatible provider later without changing core/domain source;
- exactly one provider should be present in a runtime composition;
- provider/backend versions are pinned centrally by Maven dependency management rather than scattered through modules.

This keeps provider selection replaceable at the executable boundary while allowing the reusable
application core to provide the default JUL logging infrastructure and its configuration contract.

## Default executable application

`timing-point-app` is the first executable consumer of the application-core library.

Its executable package is deliberately thin:

```text
io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.app/
  Main.java
```

The application core owns the reusable SI-01 runtime and supporting infrastructure:

```text
io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming/timingpoint/
  runtime/
    Application.java
    Composition.java
    Lifecycle.java
    config/
      Config.java
      Presentation.java
      Api.java
      YamlLoader.java
  infra/
    BuildIdentity.java
    EmbeddedBuildIdentityLoader.java
    logging/
      Logging.java
      LoggingConfig.java
      LoggingLevel.java
      LoggingFileConfig.java
      LoggingControl.java
      TimestampedFileLogHandler.java
      CompactLogFormatter.java
    loggingserver/
      LoggingServer.java
      LoggingServerConfig.java
      LiveLogHandler.java
```

`runtime/` owns knowledge of the concrete running application: `Application`, `Composition`, `Lifecycle` and the effective composition configuration. Figure SI01-01 shows this explicitly as the **Runtime** block. Runtime is not another business/domain layer; it is where the executable object graph is assembled and its lifecycle is coordinated.

The package namespace carries the context, so runtime class names stay short. There is no second bootstrap component and no `Application.Builder`: `Composition` constructs the current application graph directly. Presentation, I/O, Platform and Infrastructure objects keep their own architectural ownership even when runtime composition creates or starts them.

The executable artifact remains deliberately thin. Its launcher/input adapter stays under `...eventtiming.app`; reusable logging remains Infrastructure support. The IF-11 YAML mapper stays with `runtime.config` because it knows the concrete runtime configuration schema.

```text
timing-point-core.jar
  io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.infra/
    BuildIdentity.java
    EmbeddedBuildIdentityLoader.java

  io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.runtime/
    Application.java
    Composition.java
    Lifecycle.java
    config/
      Config.java
      Presentation.java
      Api.java
      YamlLoader.java

timing-point-app.jar
  io.github.brainboxemb.eventtiming.timingpoint.app/
    Main.java
```

`timing-point-core.jar` contains the JUL-based default logging infrastructure but still does **not** select an SLF4J provider. Provider selection remains an executable-composition concern: the default app contributes `slf4j-jdk14` at runtime, while another consumer may choose another compatible composition and omit the default `Logging` component.

The target executable startup/configuration flow is:

```text
main()
  -> core EmbeddedBuildIdentityLoader
       -> executable-provided filtered build resource
  -> configuration resolution
       -> selected built-in application-profile defaults
       -> selected platform defaults
       -> selected operating-mode defaults
       -> explicit IF-11 YAML deployment overrides
       -> secret resolution
       -> validated effective runtime Config
  -> Logging
       -> configure JUL level + console/file handlers
  -> optional LoggingServer
       -> attach live handler + diagnostics listener
       -> use Logging for current level / common formatting
  -> core runtime.Composition
       -> select/construct concrete presentation/I/O/platform/infra objects
       -> create reusable application/domain/runtime objects
       -> install/start presentation and shutdown handling
  -> runtime.Application
```

The current `runtime.config.YamlLoader` implements only the explicit
YAML subset already needed by the running application. Profile/platform/mode
resolution is the next configuration responsibility; the architecture does not
require a new public Java type for each source before that behaviour is
implemented.

`BuildIdentity` and runtime `Config` are different inputs. Build identity is artifact provenance; application configuration is deployment composition defined by IF-11. The executable embeds deterministic provenance fields (`application`, `version`, exact `revision`, `sourceRef`, `buildOrigin`, `dirty`, `apiVersion`). Wall-clock build time, CI run/build id and actor/user are not embedded because they are per-run metadata rather than stable build inputs/context.

Reusable application behaviour should not migrate into the executable merely because the architectural responsibility is called `application`. When a reusable application-core runtime object becomes justified by real shared behaviour, executables should **compose** that object rather than extend a `BaseApplication` hierarchy.

The application core uses one explicit runtime composition boundary. There is no builder layered on top of another bootstrap object. `runtime.Composition` constructs the current graph and returns/starts `runtime.Application`.

The default IF-11 file syntax is YAML and its parser/mapping stays beside the effective runtime configuration model. `runtime.config.YamlLoader` maps external YAML into `runtime.config.Config`; it is not a generic Infrastructure YAML utility. As profile support is implemented, configuration support resolves built-in profile/platform/mode defaults plus explicit deployment YAML before runtime composition starts.

The resolver responsibility must remain data/composition oriented:

- application profiles are data/default templates, not Java subclasses;
- do not introduce profile-specific Application subclasses or a
  profile-specific domain hierarchy;
- profile defaults may select topology/cardinality and capability defaults;
- platform defaults may select environment-specific values;
- operating-mode defaults may replace real providers with simulated providers;
- explicit IF-11 deployment values have highest non-secret precedence;
- `runtime.Composition` consumes only the resolved/validated runtime `Config` and contains no profile-name switches.

SnakeYAML is therefore an application-core implementation dependency; the IF-11 contract
remains independent of SnakeYAML APIs and another input adapter may construct the
same typed effective runtime `Config` without YAML.

Build-identity interpretation is reusable for the same reason. The application core owns
`BuildIdentity` and `EmbeddedBuildIdentityLoader`. The concrete executable still owns
the filtered `event-timing-build.properties` resource and build-time provenance injection,
because those values identify that executable artifact. The core loader only interprets
the classpath resource and has no dependency on `app.Main` or another app class.

The implemented presentation structure is:

```text
presentation/
  interfaces/
    console/
      LocalConsole
    shell/
      RemoteShellServer
    api/
      HttpEndpoint
      WebSocketEndpoint
      MessageWriter
  common/
    terminal/
      TerminalSession
```

Console and remote shell are separate presentation interfaces. They share only the
line-oriented command-session behaviour in `presentation.common.terminal`; both call
the same `PresentationGateway` and shutdown callback.

Console, Remote Shell and API are baseline Timing Point Application capabilities.
Application profiles do not add/remove or redefine their command/status semantics.
Concrete network listener bindings remain deployment configuration, so a listener
may still be explicitly left unbound/disabled without creating another profile.

A06/A07 are the first slice of the functional **API**:

```text
HttpEndpoint
  +-- GET /api/v1/version
  +-- GET /api/v1/status
            \
             +--> PresentationGateway.version() / status()
            /
WebSocketEndpoint
  +-- WS /api/v1/events
  +-- STATUS_SNAPSHOT on connect/reconnect
  +-- STATUS_CHANGED only for real status changes
```

`MessageWriter` owns the IF-03 wire/JSON representation shared by the Remote
API HTTP and WebSocket transports. It is not application/control logic and therefore
does not live in the application layer or in global presentation common code.

The local class names deliberately omit the `Api` prefix because the enclosing `presentation.interfaces.api` package already supplies that functional context. `Endpoint` is used rather than `Server` for the transport-facing classes; in particular, `HttpServer` is avoided because the implementation uses `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` internally.

The first WebSocket implementation uses `Java-WebSocket 1.6.0` in the reusable
application core and keeps the accepted A06 JDK HTTP server unchanged rather than replacing
both transports with a larger combined stack.

A browser-based engineering client, if added, should consume the API like any other external client. It does not require a separate SI-01 `presentation.web` package.

Manual inspection is provided by an independent development tool:

```text
test-client/
  TestClientApplication      plain Java launcher
          |
          v
  TestClientFxApplication    JavaFX development view
          |
          +-- ApiClient          HTTP/JSON client
          +-- ApiEventClient       Java 17 WebSocket client
          +-- RemoteShellClient          A05 raw TCP shell client
          |
          v
        SI-01
```

`test-client/` is a standalone Java-17 application and does not depend on
`timing-point-core` or `timing-point-app` implementation code. It may,
however, depend on the separately reusable `event-timing-data` artifact because
TimingData codec/provider reuse is now a real cross-executable requirement. This
preserves the external-client boundary while allowing SI-01 and the Engineering
Client to exercise the exact same public or proprietary TimingData translator.

The Engineering Client remains engineering support rather than the planned SI-02
GUI, and its JavaFX choice does not select the SI-02 GUI technology.

The shared Presentation-facing application gateway remains small:
`PresentationGateway.version()` returns build identity and
`PresentationGateway.status()` obtains the current TimingNode status through the
TimingNode query/ownership boundary used by the current presentation adapters;
it does not assemble status by reading node-owned fields directly.

## TimingNode active-object execution and persistence

The Java design implements the **Active Object pattern** for each TimingNode,
but does not make `TimingNode` inherit from an `ActiveObject` base class.

The architectural rule is simple:

```text
TimingNode
  +-- one bounded serial execution boundary
  +-- one worker active at a time
  |
  +-- passive LogBook
  +-- passive NextUpTeams
  +-- passive StageStartTimes
  +-- passive RaceData
  |
  +-- per-type store ports
```

This gives one writer for all mutable per-node state and one clear ordering
between registration, lifecycle, next-up and reference-data changes.

### Why composition instead of an ActiveObject base class

A reusable base class such as `TimingNode extends ActiveObject<Work>` is
possible, but it would couple the domain type to one threading mechanism.
Composition keeps that choice replaceable and lets the public TimingNode API stay
synchronous and domain-oriented.

For state-dependent operations the caller waits for the result produced on the
TimingNode lane. Queue admission and the processed operation result are represented
separately:

```java
final class TimingNode {
    private final TimingNodeLogic logic;
    private final SerialWorker serialWorker;

    <R> R invoke(TimingNodeCommand<R> command) {
        // admit + wait for the processed result
    }

    CommandAdmission submit(TimingNodeCommand<?> command) {
        // admit only; producer returns immediately
    }

    <R> R query(TimingNodeQuery<R> query) {
        // ordered consistency-sensitive read
    }
}

final class TimingNodeLogic {
    private Lifecycle lifecycle = Lifecycle.CLOSED;
    private LocationId locationId;
    private final LogBook logBook;

    OpenResult open() {
        // domain decision only; no queue/future/timeout mechanics here
    }
}
```

The visible `TimingNode` keeps execution mechanics around the component boundary, while `TimingNodeLogic` keeps the stateful domain behaviour readable. Queue admission and the processed domain result remain separate; moving the mutable logic out of the boundary does not make `TimingNodeLogic` externally addressable.

The public methods above are illustrative signatures, not a requirement to use
those exact result class names. The important split is:

```text
open(locationId) / close / consistency-sensitive query
    -> queued internally
    -> execute against current ordered TimingNode state
    -> caller receives processed domain result

device/callback ingress that is explicitly submission-only
    -> bounded queue admission result
    -> callback may continue immediately
    -> later processing has no synchronous caller waiting for its domain result
```

A queue-admission result is never used as a substitute for the domain result of
a state-dependent command.

The Future used to connect the queued work with a waiting caller is an internal
Active Object mechanism. It does not appear in the normal TimingNode
application/domain interface. In Java 8 a plain `Future<R>` is sufficient for
this first design; `CompletionStage` is not required by the current synchronous
caller contract.

Code already running on the TimingNode lane uses direct private/domain methods
such as `doOpen()` rather than calling the blocking public `open()` method
again. Re-entering a public blocking operation from the same serial lane would
wait on work that cannot run until the current work item finishes.

### Operation results and execution failures

Keep domain outcomes separate from failures of the execution boundary.

For example:

```text
OpenResult
  OPENED
  ALREADY_OPEN
  NO_LOCATION

submission/execution failure
  queue full
  node stopping/unavailable
  unexpected internal failure

wait timeout
  caller stopped waiting
  operation may still be queued or executing
  final domain outcome is unknown to that caller
```

A domain rejection such as `NO_LOCATION` is a normal processed result. Queue
full or a stopping worker means the operation was not admitted and belongs to an
operation/execution exception rather than `OpenResult`.

A timeout is different again. It means only that the caller did not receive the
processed result within the configured guard time. TimingNode timeout handling
must not automatically cancel or interrupt an already accepted state change.
The caller must treat the final outcome as unknown and re-query/reconcile state
before assuming that the command did not happen.

The first implementation may expose a small TimingNode-specific exception family
rather than leaking `TimeoutException`, `ExecutionException` or
`InterruptedException` from `java.util.concurrent` through the domain API.
Keep that family small and add distinct exception types only where callers need
different recovery behaviour. Timeout is a useful distinct case because its
outcome semantics differ from definite submission rejection.

### First SerialWorker implementation

The first implementation remains a small composed worker backed by one bounded
queue and one dedicated thread. Its public result types make the two result
moments explicit:

Project-owned SI-01 runtime threads use the diagnostic name form
`tp-<owner>-<role>[-<identity>]`. The prefix makes Timing Point Application
threads easy to separate from JDK, Maven/JGit and third-party library threads in
a debugger, profiler or thread dump. The owner abbreviations used by the current
runtime are `prl` (Presentation), `dml` (Domain), `inf` (Infrastructure) and
`run` (Runtime/composition).

Examples:

```text
tp-prl-console
tp-prl-api-http
tp-prl-remote-shell
tp-inf-live-log
tp-inf-live-log-writer
tp-run-shutdown
tp-dml-node-<NodeId>
```

Name a thread for the functional component that owns the work, not merely the
low-level helper that allocates the Java `Thread`. The TimingNode serial lane is
therefore `tp-dml-node-<NodeId>` even though `SerialWorker` is a Platform
primitive. The final suffix is the configured NodeId, not a worker/index number.
Threads owned by the JDK or external libraries keep their own names.

```java
final class SerialWorker implements AutoCloseable {
    enum AdmissionResult {
        ACCEPTED,
        FULL,
        NOT_RUNNING
    }

    static final class SubmitResult<R> {
        AdmissionResult admission();
        Future<R> futureResult();
    }

    <R> SubmitResult<R> submit(Callable<R> work) {
        // Non-blocking queue admission.
        // futureResult() exists only when admission() == ACCEPTED.
    }

    AdmissionResult offer(Runnable work) {
        // Submission-only producer path: queue admission is the only result.
    }
}
```

Usage rules:

- `AdmissionResult` answers only whether the bounded serial lane accepted the
  work item;
- `SubmitResult.futureResult()` is the Java `Future<R>` for the later
  processed result and is available only for accepted work;
- a successful `ACCEPTED` admission must never be interpreted as a successful
  domain operation;
- `offer(Runnable)` is reserved for producer paths that intentionally need no
  synchronous processed result;
- result-bearing TimingNode operations normally convert FULL/NOT_RUNNING into
  their small operation/execution failure model, then wait on the Future with
  the configured guard timeout.

The TimingNode wrapper exposes the same distinction semantically:

- `invoke(command)` uses the result-bearing `SerialWorker.submit(Callable)` path;
- `submit(command)` uses the admission-only `SerialWorker.offer(Runnable)` path;
- ordinary submission-only command failures occur after the producer has returned and therefore must be reported through diagnostics/status rather than silently disappearing;
- `query(query)` is result-bearing and normally uses the same ordered lane for consistency-sensitive reads.

The concrete internal queue/task implementation and shutdown-loop details may
change. The required behaviour is:

- queue capacity is visible and bounded;
- FIFO order is preserved for one TimingNode;
- at most one work item for that TimingNode executes at a time;
- state-dependent validation happens in that ordered execution context;
- result-bearing work has an internal Future that is completed by execution;
- submission-only ingress can observe definite queue admission without waiting
  for later domain processing;
- one ordinary work-item failure must not silently kill the worker;
- an unexpected failure is reported and completes a waiting operation as a
  technical failure; the worker may continue only when TimingNode state is known
  to remain consistent;
- shutdown stops new admission first and lets already accepted work drain within
  the controlled shutdown policy.

The worker starts only after the TimingNode has completed construction/recovery
and before the node is exposed for normal operation. During controlled shutdown,
new work is rejected before the worker drains accepted work and stops. An
operation waiting for a result may therefore complete normally during draining;
an operation that cannot be admitted because shutdown has started fails
immediately as unavailable.

Do **not** use `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` for this boundary: its
normal work queue is unbounded and hides the overload behaviour we need to
control.

A `ThreadPoolExecutor` configured with one thread and an
`ArrayBlockingQueue` can implement the same semantics. It remains a valid
alternative, especially if several TimingNodes later share a small executor.
The first dedicated `SerialWorker` is chosen for transparency, not because the
JDK executor framework is unsuitable.

If the implementation later moves to a shared executor, these invariants remain:

```text
per TimingNode:
  FIFO order
  at most one work item executing
  bounded queued work
  visible overload
  Future result corresponds to execution on that ordered lane
```

### TimingData commit

The queue does not contain a pre-numbered TimingData record. Sequence is chosen
on the worker immediately before persistence:

```java
private void processRegistration(RegistrationInput input) {
    long sequence = logBook.nextSequence();

    TimingDataFactory.Context context =
        timingDataContext(sequence, activeLocationId, input.effectiveTime(), timeSource.now());

    RegistrationId registrationId = raceData.resolveRegistrationId(input);

    TimingData data;
    if (input.isAutomatic()) {
        data = timingDataFactory.createAutomaticRegistration(context, registrationId);
    } else {
        data = timingDataFactory.createManualRegistration(
                context, registrationId, input.timeSource());
    }

    timingDataStore.append(data);    // durable before return
    logBook.add(data);               // committed domain state
    newTimingDataEvent.emit(data);
}
```

Only the TimingNode worker calls this commit path, so a producer lock around
sequence allocation is unnecessary.

`LogBook.nextSequence()` reads committed state and does not consume the value.
If append fails, LogBook is unchanged and retry uses the same next sequence. The
worker must not process a later timing record ahead of that failed record.

### Passive LogBook and TimingNode-owned reads

`LogBook` has no worker thread. It stores immutable `TimingData` values,
but it is contained mutable TimingNode state rather than a globally readable
repository.

Code outside the TimingNode ownership boundary does not read the mutable
LogBook list directly. A consistency-sensitive query enters the TimingNode lane
and performs its bounded read in the same ordering as state changes.

The read representation is deliberately not fixed to a copied list. The current
Step-4 bounded IF-03 range/latest implementation traverses the owned LogBook
records directly on the TimingNode lane and builds only the final response
representation; no temporary LogBook `List` copy escapes the owner. Network
write/send remains outside the TimingNode lane.

For future range/latest/ranking-style access, prefer direct bounded traversal of
the owned records when that avoids unnecessary allocation and GC pressure. A query may
instead use compact derived/indexed state, reusable scratch storage or a copied
view when measurements show that approach is cheaper overall.

The important guarantees are:

- each consistency-sensitive read has a defined place in the same ordering as
  state changes;
- no external consumer retains a mutable collection owned by TimingNode;
- long or blocking I/O work does not execute on the TimingNode lane;
- read strategy is selected from measured CPU, allocation/GC and lane-occupancy
  behaviour rather than convenience alone.

A high-frequency status/read path may later use a worker-published immutable
snapshot when measurement justifies it. Such a published snapshot is an
explicit read model with known freshness semantics, not permission for callers
to read TimingNode-owned mutable objects directly.

### Per-type stores

Use a separate persistence boundary for each state type whose history/snapshots
need to be kept:

| Store | First purpose | Commit role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TimingDataPersistence` | append/load canonical TimingData | durable append is required before LogBook visibility; source for LogBook rebuild |
| future per-type persistence components | preserve accepted analysis history/snapshots | do not make the lower storage layer own domain semantics |

The lower I/O layer exposes storage mechanics rather than domain-specific store
interfaces. The first implementation uses:

```text
Domain
  DefaultTimingDataPersistence
    - TimingDataCodec
    - TimingNodeId validation
    - sequence validation
           |
           v
I/O
  AppendOnlyRecordStore
           ^
           |
  FileAppendOnlyRecordStore
    - LF/CRLF framing
    - incomplete-tail repair
    - directory/file handling
    - FileChannel.force(true)
```

Runtime composition creates the file store and supplies it to
`DefaultTimingDataPersistence`. No class under `io.storage` imports a Domain
or Application class.

The TimingNode worker fixes the order in which state changes execute against the node-owned state. The
first implementation may call the small/infrequent analysis-store writes on the
same worker. If measurements show that one of those writes delays registrations,
the worker can hand an immutable snapshot to a bounded storage executor. Do not
add one thread per state object and do not introduce an unbounded background
queue.

For the first registration path, synchronous persistence on the node lane is an accepted design trade-off because producer callbacks do not wait for that work: they return after command admission. The remaining risk is queue growth and increased command latency when storage stalls. Measure store latency, queue high-water and registration burst behaviour before moving durability work off-lane; any later asynchronous persistence design must preserve the commit-before-LogBook/event ordering contract.

For example, a StageStartTimes update may be:

```text
TimingNode worker
  -> validate received snapshot
  -> replace StageStartTimes live state
  -> StageStartTimesStore.append(snapshot for analysis)
```

After a reboot, the live protocol can send the current StageStartTimes again
(for example as part of OPEN handling). The historical file is still retained
for analysis.

### Simple typed events

Post-fact notifications use a small local `Event<T>` abstraction rather than a
central event bus. The reusable mechanism lives under `platform.events` because it
is a small JDK-only reusable primitive rather than domain semantics, external I/O
or concrete infrastructure.

Conceptually:

```java
interface EventSource<T> {
    boolean subscribe(Consumer<T> listener);
    boolean unsubscribe(Consumer<T> listener);
}

final class Event<T> implements EventSource<T> {
    DeliveryReport emit(T value);
}
```

A component owns the mutable `Event<T>` instance and is the only code that emits
the fact. Consumers receive an `EventSource<T>` subscription-only view, so they
subscribe directly without gaining permission to publish the event.

For committed TimingData the component owns an explicitly named post-fact event:

```java
private final Event<TimingData> timingDataCommittedEvent = new Event<>();

public EventSource<TimingData> timingDataCommittedEvent() {
    return timingDataCommittedEvent;
}
```

The commit path is therefore:

```text
TimingNode serial lane
  -> persist TimingData
  -> update committed LogBook state
  -> timingDataCommittedEvent.emit(timingData)
       |
       +--> subscribed listener
       +--> subscribed listener
```

The first design has no central dispatcher or string/topic routing; listeners
subscribe directly to the exposed event source they need. The event name states
the completed fact: a processed registration attempt that does not commit
TimingData does not emit this event.

Listeners must not become alternate owners of TimingNode mutable state. Slow
network delivery or retry work must also not block the TimingNode serial lane;
a listener that needs such work hands the TimingData value to its own bounded
execution/delivery mechanism.

The `Event<T>` listener registry is thread-safe and uses snapshot iteration, so
subscribe/unsubscribe may race safely with delivery. Delivery itself is
synchronous on the emitting thread and `Event<T>` does not serialize concurrent
`emit(...)` calls. An owner that requires ordering or non-overlapping callbacks
must emit from its own ordered execution boundary. TimingNode status-change and
committed-TimingData events are therefore emitted from the TimingNode serial
lane.

This is part of the same ingress/latency risk analysis: a synchronous local listener is acceptable only when it is demonstrably short and non-blocking. A WebSocket or other transport adapter must enqueue/buffer its outbound work and return quickly, or introduce its own bounded delivery executor. The TimingNode lane is not a network backpressure mechanism.

If listener notification fails after the record is committed, that does not
roll back the TimingData commit. A consumer that needs reliable recovery uses
authoritative persisted/LogBook state and its own reconciliation/delivery
mechanism.

Other local events may use the same `Event<T>` abstraction when a real consumer
needs them. Do not introduce events merely to replace ordinary direct method
calls.

### Multiple TimingNodes

The semantic requirement is one serial execution lane per TimingNode, not
permanently one operating-system thread per node.

For the first one-node application:

```text
1 TimingNode
  -> 1 SerialWorker
       -> 1 bounded queue
       -> 1 dedicated worker thread
  -> passive state objects
  -> store dependencies
```

If a later multi-node application shows that one thread per node is too
expensive, multiple SerialWorkers may share a small executor while preserving
the per-node invariants above.

### Raspberry-Pi implementation rules

For the initial Pi-oriented runtime:

- keep each TimingNode work queue bounded;
- prefer explicit bounded queues over hidden/unbounded executor queues;
- keep contained domain state passive and single-writer where practical;
- keep concrete TimingData values immutable after creation;
- avoid routine LogBook list copies or deep copies when direct bounded traversal is sufficient;
- consider reusable scratch storage, compact indexes or incremental derived state only when measurement shows a clear benefit;
- move blocking network/retry work behind capability-specific output boundaries;
- add asynchronous analysis-store writing only when measurement justifies it;
- measure queue high-water, store latency, LogBook copy time, heap/GC behaviour
  and query latency before increasing concurrency.

## Shared TimingData library and concrete profiles

Both SI-01 and the Engineering Client need common TimingData contracts without
depending on the whole SI-01 application core. The shared artifact therefore
owns the semantic interfaces and value types that every supported TimingData
profile must implement; it does **not** require one concrete record class for all
profiles.

The first traced Java semantic model is intentionally small:

```text
shared/timing-data
  TimingData
    common TimingNodeId / sequence / LocationId / time access
    AutomaticRegistration
      RegistrationId
    ManualRegistration
      RegistrationId
      ManualTimeSource
    ManualTimeSource
    RecordKey
  LocationId
  RegistrationId
  TimingTimestamp
  TimingDataFactory
    Context
  TimingDataCodec
    CodecException
  TimingDataProvider

default profile
  DefaultTimingDataFactory
    private automatic/manual immutable implementations
  DefaultTimingDataCodec

test / product-specific profile
  DummyEventTimingDataFactory
    private profile-specific immutable implementations
  DummyEventTimingDataCodec
```

There is no intermediate public `RegistrationData` interface. Automatic and
manual registration are already the useful type-safe variants, so another level
would add hierarchy without giving callers a stronger contract.

`LocationId` and `RegistrationId` are standalone shared value types because
they are used at boundaries beyond one concrete TimingData subtype. They define
stable Java/IF-05 representations and only minimal structural validity. Concrete
event/profile/reference-data meaning and allowed values remain outside the shared
library.

Likewise, `TimingNodeStateData` and `RegistrationRevokedData` are not created
from old record-enum values. UC-002 still defers OPEN/CLOSE-as-TimingData and the
current use-case baseline does not require revocation. Add those semantic types
only after a promoted requirement justifies them.

The semantic interfaces are common. A configured profile supplies simple
immutable implementing classes:

```java
TimingData.AutomaticRegistration automatic =
        timingDataFactory.createAutomaticRegistration(context, registrationId);

TimingData.ManualRegistration manual =
        timingDataFactory.createManualRegistration(
                context, registrationId, TimingData.ManualTimeSource.OPERATOR_ENTERED);
```

The return types preserve variant type safety even when the configured provider
returns a different concrete implementation.

### Stateless TimingData factory

`TimingDataFactory` is a stateless construction service. It does not validate
TimingNode lifecycle policy, allocate sequence numbers, resolve `TagId` or
`TeamId`, commit data, own a LogBook or publish events. Those responsibilities
stay with the TimingNode and its contained domain components.

Source/reference resolution happens before factory construction:

```text
TagId  -----> RaceData ----\
                         +--> RegistrationId
TeamId -----> RaceData ----/
```

The factory receives the already selected common construction values in one
generic context and only the extra values required by the requested variant:

```java
TimingData.AutomaticRegistration createAutomaticRegistration(
        TimingDataFactory.Context context,
        RegistrationId registrationId);

TimingData.ManualRegistration createManualRegistration(
        TimingDataFactory.Context context,
        RegistrationId registrationId,
        TimingData.ManualTimeSource timeSource);
```

```text
TimingDataFactory.Context
  timingNodeId
  sequenceNumber
  locationId
  effectiveTime
  recordedAt
```

For the current manual variant, `TimingData.ManualTimeSource` is constrained to
`SYSTEM_ASSIGNED` or `OPERATOR_ENTERED`. Automatic registration uses observed
time by definition, so callers do not pass an `origin` or `OBSERVED` flag
merely to restate the return type.

The context contains values only. It does not contain `TimingNode`, `LogBook`,
stores, services or other mutable collaborators.

The first implementation does not need an abstract TimingData base class.
Concrete immutable implementations may delegate to `TimingDataFactory.Context`.
Introduce a private/protected helper only when multiple real implementations show
enough repeated behaviour to justify it; such a helper remains implementation
reuse, not an additional public semantic layer.

### Provider boundary

A `TimingDataProvider` supplies a coherent family:

```text
TimingDataProvider
  stable provider/profile id
  TimingDataFactory
  TimingDataCodec
```

The factory creates the concrete in-memory TimingData objects. The codec
encodes/decodes the same profile family.
The built-in default/reference codec uses Jackson's streaming API only; JSON Lines
record framing, durable append and incomplete-tail recovery remain store responsibilities. Provider discovery and configuration
remain bootstrap/infrastructure concerns.

The provider therefore does more than representation translation, but it still
does not own TimingNode business rules. It chooses the concrete TimingData
implementation and its representation while preserving the common semantic
contracts defined by IF-05.

Both the Java-8 SI-01 runtime and Java-17 Engineering Client can depend on
`event-timing-data`. The Engineering Client may inspect the common interfaces
without depending on SI-01 Domain classes. Profile-specific inspection can be
added only where a real consumer needs it.

The first implementation keeps the default/reference profile inside the shared
TimingData library while the design is still changing; do not create another
production Maven artifact solely to mirror the conceptual profile split. A dummy
event-specific implementation in tests is sufficient to prove that the common
contract does not accidentally depend on the default concrete classes. A
separate provider artifact becomes justified when a real independently deployed
profile exists.

This artifact contains no SI-01 runtime/application classes and no JavaFX code.
Its Java API must remain usable from both the Java-8 SI-01 baseline and the
Java-17 Engineering Client.

## Derived consumers

The application core is deliberately not tied to one executable topology. Plausible consumers include:

```text
single-system application
multi-system / simulation application
public reference/test application
private/product application
```

These are consumer possibilities, not modules to create now.

## Java 8 extension/provider mechanism

A concrete public/private extension requirement now exists, so provider discovery
is no longer merely a future possibility. Keep the mechanism narrow and
composition-oriented:

```text
runtime.Composition
  -> infra extension discovery support
       -> discover built-in providers
       -> discover external provider JARs
  -> ExtensionRegistry
       TimingDataProvider
       UpstreamProtocolProvider
       AntennaProvider
       CanProtocolProvider
       DisplayProtocolProvider
  -> validate configured provider IDs
  -> create normal typed implementations
  -> compose runtime.Application
```

For the Java 8 baseline, external discovery can use a dedicated `URLClassLoader`
plus standard `ServiceLoader` SPI metadata. Discovery happens during startup;
runtime hot reload/unload is deliberately out of scope. The provider registry
combines built-in and external providers and rejects duplicate provider IDs.

Provider contracts belong with the capability whose meaning they create;
class-loader/discovery mechanics belong under application-core Infrastructure support. Domain,
application and I/O runtime code must not depend on `URLClassLoader`,
`ServiceLoader` or a generic `Plugin` interface.

`SimulatedAntenna` and its provider are built into the public baseline and are
always available. External antenna JARs add alternative `AntennaProvider`
implementations. The same typed pattern is available for concrete TimingData,
UpstreamProtocol, CAN-protocol and display-protocol implementations where a
public/private or vendor boundary requires it.

IF-11 selects providers by stable provider ID. Missing providers, duplicate IDs
or an incompatible provider/configuration combination fail during validation or
startup rather than silently falling back to another implementation.

The exact external-JAR directory/layout, dependency isolation strategy and
whether the provider contracts eventually justify a separately versioned SPI
artifact remain implementation/evidence-driven decisions.

## Public/private composition

Expected private/product-specific areas may include:

- production RFID control/protocol details;
- product-specific I/O/protocol implementations;
- production asset/source inventory and mappings;
- production upstream/backoffice schemas/codecs where sensitive;
- deployment-specific composition/policies.

Prefer normal composition and constructor/factory injection. Do not introduce a subclass-based `BaseApplication` extension model. The provider mechanism above is the explicit runtime-extension boundary; do not generalise it into arbitrary plugin access from domain/application code.

## Possible future artifacts

Create future artifacts only when a real boundary requires them. Candidates might eventually include:

- RabbitMQ/messaging I/O;
- Linux/Raspberry-Pi platform support;
- public/private RFID/CAN I/O implementations;
- separately versioning `event-timing-data` if binary compatibility/release evidence later requires an independent release cycle;
- reusable test support.

Splitting later is preferred over speculative libraries, provided package/responsibility boundaries remain clean enough to extract.

## Architecture/dependency checks

Useful automated rules may include:

- presentation packages do not own or persist application state;
- domain services do not reference presentation or concrete I/O classes;
- platform packages do not depend on event-timing application/domain behaviour;
- wire/protocol classes stay with their presentation or I/O capability;
- semantic contracts are not moved into transport packages merely because transport code uses them;
- public code contains no real deployment mappings or proprietary values;
- domain/application/runtime components do not depend on extension class-loader mechanics;
- duplicate provider IDs and unknown configured provider IDs fail deterministically;
- the executable consumes `timing-point-core` rather than copying/forking application-core source;
- the core artifact does not carry a concrete SLF4J provider/backend transitively;
- an executable runtime contains exactly one intended SLF4J provider.

## Open detailed-design decisions

- exact package granularity after real application/domain classes exist;
- final package naming where capability-oriented packages prove clearer than layer names;
- exact reusable boundary between single-instance runtime mechanics and multi-system application orchestration;
- exact bounded TimingNode work-queue capacity and queue-full operational policy after Raspberry-Pi burst/latency measurement;
- exact guard timeout for synchronous TimingNode operations and how it is configured/exposed diagnostically;
- concrete immutable TimingNode read-view representation and compact LogBook indexing required by the first ranking/query implementation;
- exact external extension-JAR directory/layout and dependency-isolation policy;
- private Maven artifact publication/consumption mechanism;
- version alignment between public core/provider contracts and private implementations;
- which I/O capabilities eventually deserve independent artifacts;
- whether and when provider contracts deserve a dedicated independently versioned SPI artifact;
- exact field logging configuration/rotation/retention policy in the default executable.
