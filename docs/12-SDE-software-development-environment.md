# Software Development Environment (SDE)

Status: working draft / non-authoritative

This Software Development Environment document defines the **concrete engineering environment and repository conventions** used to develop, build, test, document and review the software system.

The SDE is project/software-system level and applies across software items and implementation repositories unless a repository documents a justified exception.

## Document boundary

The SDE is not the high-level development plan and it is not the detailed implementation sequence.

Use the documents as follows:

```text
SDP  why/how the project is developed at high level: strategy, phases, risks, resources, assumptions
SIP  what is implemented next: concrete steps, deliverables, demonstrations and exit evidence
SDE  where/how engineering work is performed: repositories, tooling, GitHub flow, CI, artifacts, local environments
SVP  how the product is verified: levels, profiles, verification cases and evidence
```

The SDE may define detailed mechanisms that support the SDP/SIP/SVP, but should not duplicate their planning or verification content.

## Purpose

The development environment should make work:

- reproducible;
- reviewable;
- traceable from issue through implementation and verification;
- usable by both human developers and AI agents;
- consistent across public and private repositories;
- suitable for generated documentation and build artifacts;
- easy to reconstruct on a new workstation or CI runner;
- simple enough for a small project without losing engineering discipline.

## Development hosts and execution environments

The high-level need for development/test hardware belongs in the SDP. This SDE defines how those environments are used once selected.

Expected environment classes are:

```text
Developer workstation
  primary interactive development
  initially Windows
  Java/Maven/Python/Git
  optional Docker/Compose

GitHub-hosted CI
  build/unit/system/integration automation where supported
  generated documentation/artifacts

Raspberry Pi Zero target
  generated target image
  pinned ARMv6-compatible Java runtime
  SI-01 service
  target/resource/HIL verification

Optional integration host
  broker/test services
  test drivers/simulators
  longer integration workloads
```

Exact host provisioning scripts and image tooling are introduced by the relevant SIP steps and implementation repositories.

## Primary development services and tools

Current baseline:

- **GitHub** — source control, issues, pull requests and review history;
- **GitHub Actions** — automated build, test, generated documentation and later image/deployment workflows;
- **Git** — source/version control;
- **Maven** — Java build/dependency-management baseline;
- **Java 8** — initial SI-01 language/API/runtime baseline;
- **Python** — lightweight project tooling/document generation where appropriate;
- **draw.io + generated SVG** — editable and GitHub-readable diagrams;
- **Docker / Docker Compose** — reproducible external integration services such as RabbitMQ where a real service materially improves verification.

Individual repositories may add tools, but system-wide additions should be deliberate and documented.

## Repository baseline

Every implementation or coordination repository is expected to contain at least:

```text
README.md
AGENTS.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

### `README.md`

The human entry point. It should normally contain:

- repository purpose;
- relationship to the wider software system;
- build/run/test entry points or links;
- important document/navigation links;
- generated-output links where applicable.

### `AGENTS.md`

Persistent repository-specific instructions for AI/coding agents, including:

- repository purpose and boundaries;
- sources of truth;
- workflow rules;
- files that must be read before work;
- public/private boundaries;
- build/test expectations;
- scope/plan discipline.

AI follows the same controlled engineering workflow as human development.

### `CHANGELOG.md`

Records notable repository changes. It does not replace Git history, issue history or PR evidence.

## Repository content layout

Exact source trees differ by repository, but use predictable top-level locations where applicable.

Typical coordination/documentation repository:

```text
README.md
AGENTS.md
CHANGELOG.md
.github/
  workflows/
docs/
reference/
tools/
bld/                 local/generated build output; normally ignored in source
```

Typical Java implementation repository may evolve toward:

```text
README.md
AGENTS.md
CHANGELOG.md
.github/
  workflows/
docs/
<module>/
  src/main/...
  src/test/...
tools/
integration/         integration fixtures/config where useful
bld/ or target/      generated output, not hand-maintained source
pom.xml
```

Do not create directories merely to satisfy a template. Introduce them when the repository has content that belongs there.

### Source versus generated versus reference material

Keep these categories distinct:

- **source** — hand-maintained code/config/documentation on normal branches;
- **generated output** — CI/build artifacts, generated documents/images/packages/images;
- **reference material** — preserved external/source documents used for research or traceability;
- **runtime/deployment data** — environment-specific configuration, secrets and mutable operational data; not normal public source.

Generated output should not be manually edited as if it were source.

## Documentation layout

Use predictable numbered document families in the meta/engineering documentation where applicable:

```text
00-09  working context, brainstorm, use cases and domain baseline
10-19  development planning/environment
20-29  requirements / SRDs
30-39  architecture and detailed design
40-49  system-level IDDs
50-59  verification planning
```

Established abbreviations include `SDP`, `SIP`, `SDE`, `SRD`, `SSAD`, `SAD`, `SDD`, `IDD`, `SVP` and `UC`.

Software-item numbers remain stable across requirement/design documents.

## GitHub issue → branch → pull-request workflow

Normal development follows a PR-first workflow:

```text
issue / work item
      ↓
feature branch
      ↓
draft pull request
      ↓
implementation + discussion + tests + evidence
      ↓
ready-for-review
      ↓
merge
```

### Issue/work-item creation

Use a GitHub issue when useful to reserve/identify work and provide a stable work number.

### Feature branch

Create from the intended target branch using:

```text
feature/pr-<N>-<short-slug>
```

Do not perform normal work directly on `main`.

### Draft PR as active work container

Create/promote the draft PR early. It carries:

- scope;
- change-specific design discussion;
- implementation commits;
- tests/results;
- generated evidence;
- deviations and deferred scope;
- review conversation.

Long-term planning documents should not become detailed activity logs when the PR can carry that evidence.

### Review and merge

Before merge:

- required checks are green;
- generated outputs have been inspected where relevant;
- important evidence is recorded;
- documentation/changelog updates are included where required;
- deferred or unresolved scope is explicit.

## Branch protection direction

Expected default-branch policy:

- require pull requests for normal merges;
- prevent force pushes;
- restrict deletion;
- allow zero required approving reviewers where appropriate for a solo-maintainer project;
- require meaningful stable CI checks once available;
- delete merged feature branches where appropriate.

Do not introduce merge queues or similarly heavy process unless there is a concrete need.

## Generated-output branches

Build outputs may be published separately from source branches.

General pattern:

```text
source PR/branch
      |
      | CI
      v
dev/pr-<N>/<output-type>
      |
      | merged main
      v
prod/<output-type>
```

Current documentation example:

```text
dev/pr-<N>/docs
prod/docs
```

Rules:

- generated branches are build output;
- the normal source branch is authoritative;
- generated PR branches exist so human/AI reviewers can inspect the real generated result before merge;
- corresponding `dev/pr-N/...` branches should be removed when the PR closes;
- `prod/...` represents output generated from merged/default-branch source.

The same approach can later be used for target images/packages when it provides useful review/release separation.

## Generated documentation

Source documentation remains Markdown plus project-controlled diagram-generator source.

The generated documentation set may contain:

- complete GitHub-readable Markdown copies;
- local SVG assets;
- editable draw.io files;
- combined review books;
- source commit/provenance metadata.

Generated documents are for review/publication. Their source Markdown remains authoritative.

## AI-assisted development environment

AI is an engineering tool inside the repository process, not an alternative process.

Before substantial work an agent should:

1. read `AGENTS.md`;
2. read handoff/active plan where present;
3. inspect the current open/draft PR;
4. inspect predecessor PR context when relevant;
5. identify the active SIP/AP scope;
6. work within that scope unless a plan correction is necessary.

An agent must not:

- bypass PR-first development;
- treat brainstorm material as approved requirements automatically;
- silently promote major architecture decisions;
- copy proprietary/private information into public source;
- edit generated branches as hand-maintained source;
- claim test/build/hardware evidence that was not actually produced.

## AI/session handoff environment

A new session should reconstruct current state from repository artifacts rather than requiring hidden conversation state.

Preferred sources include:

```text
AGENTS.md
current open/draft PR
relevant predecessor PR
active SIP/AP material
requirements / architecture / IDDs
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Active implementation evidence belongs mainly in the PR. Persistent rules belong in `AGENTS.md`; development strategy belongs in the SDP; implementation ordering belongs in the SIP.

## Build and CI environment

Implementation repositories should introduce CI from the first useful increment.

Environment expectations include:

- Maven build/test entry points that also work locally;
- Java source/bytecode baseline enforced in build configuration;
- fast checks suitable for normal PRs;
- separate integration jobs where external services make tests slower;
- target/HIL workflows separated from hosted-runner-only tests;
- generated artifacts retained or published when they improve review/traceability;
- CI configuration kept in source under `.github/workflows/`.

Which behaviours belong to unit, ST-1, ST-2, ST-3 or ST-4 is defined by the SVP; the SDE only defines the environment mechanisms that make those profiles executable.

## Test-support environment

The engineering environment should support progressively more realistic verification without forcing every developer/test to require all infrastructure.

Expected mechanisms include:

- in-process/direct fakes for unit/component work;
- executable SI-01 plus external test driver for application/system testing;
- small manual test clients where they materially improve developer inspection of a public interface;
- lightweight native socket simulator for network-loop tests;
- Docker/Compose service fixtures for RabbitMQ-specific integration;
- real Pi Zero / hardware environment for target/HIL testing.

A manual test client may use a different desktop runtime/toolchain from the constrained
SI-01 target when that boundary is explicit. It must still consume the public interface
rather than internal SI-01 classes.

Do not make Docker a prerequisite for fast tests that do not need an external service.

## Containerized integration services

Docker/Compose is appropriate for real external dependencies with meaningful connection/protocol/recovery behaviour.

RabbitMQ is the first identified example.

Environment rules:

- synthetic/public test topology and credentials only;
- no real queue/source/deployment names or secrets;
- intentionally pinned image versions/tags;
- health/readiness checks;
- same basic environment usable locally and in GitHub Actions where practical;
- simple teardown/cleanup;
- restart/failure control where recovery is under test.

Detailed verification scenarios belong in the SVP and relevant SDD, not in this SDE.

## Raspberry Pi build/deployment environment

Once the relevant SIP step begins, the implementation environment should provide reproducible automation for:

- downloading/selecting a pinned compatible base OS image;
- provisioning the pinned Java runtime;
- installing SI-01 and service files;
- embedding only safe/default public configuration;
- producing a versioned flashable image artifact;
- recording source/build provenance;
- installing a versioned application update on an existing target without requiring a full reflash;
- preserving runtime data/configuration according to the application design.

The SDE defines the automation/environment expectations; the SIP defines when these are delivered and demonstrated; detailed scripts/tool choices belong in the implementation repository.

## Public and private repository environment

Public/private separation must be enforceable by normal build structure:

- public framework repositories build/test without private source;
- private implementations consume public APIs/artifacts;
- private Maven/repository credentials use secure CI/developer credential mechanisms;
- proprietary protocols and real deployment mappings remain private;
- public integration fixtures use synthetic identities;
- public reference projects prove external consumption independently from private code.

## Secrets and configuration

Credentials, tokens, encryption keys and environment-specific secrets are not committed to source control.

Use GitHub environment/repository secrets and runtime configuration mechanisms appropriate to each target.

Public example configuration uses placeholders/synthetic values.

Exact application configuration semantics remain architecture/SDD/IDD concerns.

## Tooling reproducibility

Start with the simplest adequate reproducible mechanism:

- pinned/action-versioned CI actions;
- Maven for Java;
- Python standard library where sufficient;
- native/simple socket tooling where sufficient;
- Docker/Compose for meaningful external service dependencies;
- dedicated custom build containers only when they isolate a substantial toolchain or solve a real reproducibility problem.

Do not introduce a custom Docker image merely because a small script exists.

## Repository-specific extensions

Each repository may extend this SDE via its own `AGENTS.md`, README, workflows, build files and local development documentation.

Repository-specific rules may add constraints but should not silently weaken system-level traceability/workflow rules. Material deviations should be documented.

## Open SDE topics

Environment/convention decisions still to resolve include:

- exact developer-machine JDK provisioning;
- exact ARMv6 Java runtime provisioning mechanism;
- Maven public/private artifact repository and credential setup;
- standard Java formatting/static-analysis toolchain;
- standard unit/integration-test libraries;
- reusable repository bootstrap/template conventions;
- exact ruleset/branch-protection template;
- release/version/artifact naming conventions;
- image-builder tooling and artifact-storage mechanism;
- application-update transport/install mechanism;
- generated package/image branch/release conventions;
- exact local integration-host setup if a separate host becomes necessary;
- whether generated documentation later also produces PDF/HTML.
